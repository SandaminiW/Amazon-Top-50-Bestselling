## Final Conclusion
The analysis of Amazon’s top 50 bestselling books between 2009 and 2019 reveals several interesting patterns. Fiction books tend to dominate the bestseller list, accounting for a majority of the top sellers, though non-fiction titles are still significantly represented. Price does not appear to have a strong correlation with customer ratings, suggesting that readers are willing to pay for both highly rated and lower-rated books, depending on the content or the author’s popularity.

Books that garnered a high number of reviews generally achieved higher ratings, indicating that customer feedback plays a crucial role in a book’s long-term success. Certain authors, particularly those with multiple bestsellers, consistently perform well, which suggests the importance of brand recognition in driving sales.

Overall, the analysis shows that a combination of high-quality content, strong customer engagement through reviews, and brand recognition contributes to the commercial success of books on Amazon.
